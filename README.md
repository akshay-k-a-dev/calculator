# Calculator Project

Hey folks! So, I was sitting around, bored out of my mind, and thought, "Why not build a calculator?" Because, you know, who doesn’t need another calculator in their life?

## What’s This Thing?

Welcome to my boredom-buster project: a calculator! It’s got all the usual suspects—plus some extra flair. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division—you name it. Plus, we’ve got percentages, square roots, and powers to make you look like a math wizard at parties.

## Where’s the Fun?

## Cool Features

- **Basic Math**: For when you need to add up your lunch bill or split the check.
- **Extra Magic**: Percentage and roots, because normal math is overrated.
- **Fancy Pants Design**: Gradient background and dark mode to make your numbers look cooler.
- **Dark Mode**: Perfect for those midnight math sessions or when you want to feel like a hacker.

## How to Get This Bad Boy

1. Clone the repo (it’s like copying your friend’s homework, but legal):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshay-k-a-dev/calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder (or just open it in your browser):
   ```bash
   cd calculator
   ```

3. Open `index.html` and start calculating like a pro.
